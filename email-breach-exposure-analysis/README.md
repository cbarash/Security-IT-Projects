# Email Breach Exposure Analysis

## Objective
Identify whether a simulated email address appears in known breach datasets and assess potential security risks.

## Environment
- Simulated email data
- Public breach intelligence source
- Web browser

## Methodology
1. Submitted simulated email addresses for breach evaluation
2. Reviewed breach status and exposed data types
3. Assessed potential impact of exposure

## Findings
- One simulated email showed no breach exposure
- One simulated email appeared in a breach dataset

## Risk Analysis
Exposed email credentials increase the risk of credential stuffing, phishing, and account compromise.

## Mitigation
- Enforce password changes
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Monitor for suspicious login activity

## Disclaimer
All data used in this project is simulated and non-production.
